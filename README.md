# Custom Live Debian System
Set of scripts to create custom Live Debian System.
* Automatically calculate space used of each script. 

# Usage
1. Change `DEB_REPO_URL` variable in `build-live.sh` to point to the Debian repository URL.
1. Run `./build-live.sh`
1. Run `chroot chroot`
1. You are now in the live system(chroot), run the followings:
1. `cd /root/scripts`
1. `chmod +x install.sh`
1. `./install.sh`
1. `exit`
1. You are now out of the live system, run `./mkiso.sh` to create ISO image.

# Quickies
```
# Run these in 1 shot as ROOT to build ALL.
./build-live.sh
chroot chroot/ /bin/bash -c "cd /root/scripts; chmod +x install.sh; ./install.sh all"
./mkiso.sh

# OR
./build-live.sh && chroot chroot/ /bin/bash -c "cd /root/scripts; chmod +x install.sh; ./install.sh all" && ./mkiso.sh
```

# Transferring the iso image to USB stick
```
dd if=remaster.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M
sync
```
The `sync` bit is important as `dd` can return before the write operation finishes.

# Requirements
* `apt-get -y --force-yes install live-build squashfs-tools syslinux`
* `apt-get -y --force-yes install xorriso` 

# Analyze package sizes
```
sort install-size-history.txt | uniq | grep <script-name>
```

# Packages
* LinuxMint: http://paste.debian.net/182062/
