# Custom Live Debian System
Set of scripts to create Custom Live Debian System:
* Automatically calculate space used of each script.
* It can remaster itself while running.

It comes in 2 flavors:
* min: Strict minimum system with JWM light-weight window manager. From there, you can add your desired applications.
* std: Standard system includes minimum system + common applications.

# Usage
1. Change `DEB_REPO_URL` variable in `build-live.sh` to point to the Debian repository URL.
1. Run `./build-live.sh`
1. Run `chroot chroot`
1. You are now in the live system(chroot), run the followings:
1. `cd /root/scripts`
1. `chmod +x install.sh`
1. `./install.sh`
1. `exit`
1. You are now out of the live system, run `./mkiso.sh` to create ISO image.
